After database is created, you'll see:

```
Internal Database URL:
postgresql://survey_admin:PASSWORD@dpg-abc123def456.render.internal:5432/survey_db

Breaking it down:
- survey_admin          = Username
- PASSWORD              = Auto-generated password
- dpg-abc123def456      = Your unique database ID
- render.internal       = Internal network (use this!)
- 5432                  = PostgreSQL port (always this)
- survey_db             = Database name
```
